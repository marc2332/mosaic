## FAQ

- **Do you plan to have XY feature?**

    No.

## Crazy ideas
- **Visual clipboard** – drag&drop into clipboard situated in a near-by panel. Should be great for researching stuff.
- **Social browsing** – you'll be able to interact with people visiting the same site in real-time.
- **Visual non-linear history** – history that can branch like a git repo, always preserved navigation metadata, i.e. answering questions like *"How did I get there?"*, *"What did I do there?"*.
